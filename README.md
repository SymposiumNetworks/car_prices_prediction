# car_prices_prediction
Predicting the selling price of a used car
Features included in the dataseet include attributes like:
Mileage, Maximum Power, Kilometers Driven, Seats, Engine Capacity et al

Dependent variable i.e. selling price is right skewed and data distribution is not exactly following gaussian / normal distribution
Variable transformation is recommended and so logarithmic transformation is being tried out

As far as modelling approach is concerned 4 approaches are being tried out
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
eXtreme Gradient Booster Regressor
Artificial Neural Network
